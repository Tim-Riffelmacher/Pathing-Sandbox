# Pathing Sandbox

### What's it all about?

- Create custom graphs and traverse them with popular algorithms

---

### How it works?

- Click on the area below the toolbar to create a node
- Click on two nodes successively to connect them with the weight specified in the toolbar
- Double-click on a node to act as the new start node
- Choose an algorithm in the toolbar
- Click on "Go"

---

### What's to be considered?

- During the execution of an alogrithm some user funtions are limited
- Nodes have to be placed with a certain amount of distance between them
- Kruskal's algorithm ignores the start node due to its logic
